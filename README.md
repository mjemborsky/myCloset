# myCloset

Created by...
- Jonah Gloss - Implementing the login/signup pages and functionality.
- Michael Emborsky - Implementing the search and feed components.
- Alexa Rodriguez - Implementing the createCloset component, creating required style tags, and importing pictures.
- Taylor McMillon - Implementing the createOutfit component, as well as posting it to the PostDatabase
- Ryan Lounsbury - Implementing functionality to upload clothing items, and creating the closet page framework.

Instructions (Building/Running the Project): 
- User Interfaces will be created using SwiftUI Files. The file should be named (The page name) + view. (ex. LoginPageView)
- Interactable elements regarding the View files will be coded in a controller file. (ex. the code for controlling what the login page actually does (LoginPageController))
- Data classes can be stored in a seperate file/files. Whatever is convienent to programmer.
- Code requested to be merged into main must be at the very least able to be compiled/ran. (Will be checked by lead dev.)
